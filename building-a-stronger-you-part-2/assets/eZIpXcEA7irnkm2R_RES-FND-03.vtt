00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.250
<v ->These days, stress and change can dominate our busy lives.</v>

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.220
We may face challenging situations at work,

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.620
at home, or both.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.070
Navigating those challenges in a positive and productive way

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.450
takes resilience,

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.630
learning how to thrive in difficult circumstances.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.993
Luckily, resilience is a skill anyone can build.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.050
To define it precisely,

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.620
resilience is how well we bounce back from adverse events

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.643
or conditions.

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
Resilience isn't a trait you have or don't have,

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.340
think of it more on a scale from a little resilience

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.350
to very resilient.

14
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
Anyone can build and improve resilience with practice.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.350
Let's look at five key characteristics

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.970
of resilient people,

17
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.453
sometimes called, the five pillars of resilience.

18
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.560
Once you understand these five pillars,

19
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.660
you can work to reinforce them,

20
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.420
which will build up your resilience.

21
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.450
The first pillar is self-awareness.

22
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.240
This is the ability to understand your strengths,

23
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.940
weaknesses, and behaviors.

24
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.910
Realistic self-assessment is the first step

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.770
towards resilience.

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.440
The second pillar is your outlook.

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.590
Resilient people frame challenges as opportunities

28
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.273
for growth and learning.

29
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.290
For example, a resilient person

30
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.660
who's working on self-awareness

31
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.930
might recognize their short temper as a weakness,

32
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.720
and identify stress as a trigger.

33
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.060
They can then choose a more positive response

34
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.100
and a stressful situation.

35
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.640
They could reframe their reaction by telling themselves,

36
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.490
this stressful situation is an opportunity

37
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.400
for me to practice regulating my emotions,

38
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.463
I should take five deep breaths before I speak.

39
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.510
The third pillar is support.

40
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.890
A network of encouraging, caring, and trustworthy people

41
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.560
can help us feel valued and connected

42
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.660
when the going gets tough.

43
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
A sense of purpose is the fourth pillar.

44
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.470
Tackling challenges and service of our values or mission

45
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.353
helps us find the inner strength to keep going.

46
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.890
The final pillar is self-care.

47
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.130
It's easy to neglect self-care when we're struggling,

48
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.890
but nurturing our mental and physical health

49
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.410
gives us the energy reserves we need

50
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.173
to bounce back from stressful situations.

51
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.350
Stress is part of life,

52
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.400
but high stress can harm or burn out those experiencing it.

53
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.880
Self-awareness, outlook, support,

54
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.310
a sense of purpose, and self-care

55
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.100
are all characteristics that you can improve

56
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.280
to help you be resilient in the face of stress.

57
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.900
People who strive for resilience

58
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.660
have built up the skills needed to bounce back

59
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.170
and even thrive in challenging situations.

60
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.750
The next time you're experiencing adversity,

61
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.110
work to strengthen these five pillars of resilience.

62
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.940
Being more resilient will help you

63
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.340
through difficult situations today

64
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.903
and far into the future.
