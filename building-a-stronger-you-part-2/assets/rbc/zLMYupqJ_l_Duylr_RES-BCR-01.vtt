00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.170
<v ->Many jobs today were unheard of 20 years ago.</v>

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.850
And 20 years from now?

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.730
Well, it's impossible to know for sure,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.070
but one thing we do know is that the workforce

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.890
will likely look different than it does today.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
So how can you keep pace with our rapidly changing world?

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.230
One way is to become a lifelong learner.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.110
This video will discuss what a lifelong learner is

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.270
and why being one is important

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.180
for personal and professional fulfillment.

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.180
Also, we'll explore eight habits of lifelong learners

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.773
to help guide your journey.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.690
Lifelong learning is the desire to seek knowledge

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.450
outside of formal education.

15
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.840
Of course, lifelong learning can include taking classes

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.300
and attending lectures, but the motive

17
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.390
is not to fulfill the requirements of a degree.

18
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.390
Rather, it's a voluntary endeavor to improve one's self.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.320
Becoming a lifelong learner conveys significant benefits.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.650
First, it helps you at work.

21
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.530
Employers need workers willing and motivated

22
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.150
to learn new skills.

23
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.360
And adding skills and competencies to your resume

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.793
makes you an attractive job candidate.

25
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
Next, it keeps your brain active.

26
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.680
Learning every day keeps your mind sharp.

27
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.130
Research shows that people with lifelong learning habits

28
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.180
delay the onset of memory problems in old age.

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.690
Finally, it increases happiness.

30
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.970
It's critical to find ways to surprise

31
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.670
and delight our minds throughout our lives.

32
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.830
If you've ever mastered a tricky subject

33
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.050
or bested a personal record,

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.293
you know that improving your abilities feels great.

35
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.650
You may have noticed that a shared trait

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.760
among very successful people is a passion for learning.

37
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.900
Warren Buffet reportedly reads 500 pages per day.

38
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.170
Bill Gates likes to watch lectures online.

39
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770
Let's explore some habits of lifelong learners

40
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.863
to get you started.

41
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.880
First, they are avid readers.

42
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.270
Reading widely doesn't just spark curiosity.

43
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.050
It forces you to reassess your ideas and beliefs.

44
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.240
Staying open to new perspectives

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.550
cultivates a work-in-progress mindset

46
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.533
that fuels lifelong learning.

47
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.760
Next, they ask questions.

48
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.780
Curiosity is a strong motivator of lifelong learners.

49
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.350
To improve your curiosity, wonder aloud,

50
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.880
ponder complex problems and explore concepts in depth.

51
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.930
Seeking answers always prompts more questions.

52
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.540
Lifelong learners set goals.

53
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.040
To set learning goals,

54
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.770
think about what you want to accomplish.

55
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.880
Do you wanna master a subject or learn a new skill?

56
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.090
Setting realistic goals can help you get there.

57
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.040
Start by creating a few learning goals,

58
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.460
like I will read 10 behavioral economics books

59
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.990
by the end of the year,

60
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.863
or I will practice Mandarin for 15 minutes a day.

61
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.720
Cultivating a growth mindset is an important attribute

62
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.400
of lifelong learners.

63
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.013
So what is a growth mindset?

64
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.670
People with a growth mindset believe

65
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.600
that with effort and perseverance, they can learn anything.

66
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.790
Having a growth mindset helps you persist

67
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.040
through setbacks and obstacles.

68
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.870
This is critical for lifelong learners

69
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.450
for whom even failures are opportunities

70
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.700
to learn valuable lessons.

71
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.763
Let's take a look at four more habits of lifelong learners.

72
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.290
First, they don't limit themselves.

73
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.710
The phrase you can't teach an old dog new tricks

74
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.200
doesn't apply to lifelong learners.

75
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.750
They understand our brains can learn

76
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.730
and grow our entire lives

77
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.480
and avoid making any learning off-limits.

78
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.050
Next, they get out of their comfort zones.

79
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.420
There is vulnerability in not knowing

80
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.120
and being outside of your comfort zone.

81
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.410
Lifelong learners know

82
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.740
that continued growth may be uncomfortable,

83
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.613
but it's worth it.

84
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.250
Lifelong learners are constantly seeking information.

85
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.080
Whether it's reading articles,

86
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.620
listening to podcasts or having conversations,

87
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.080
every moment is an opportunity to learn

88
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.930
about the world and others.

89
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.100
Finally, they foster a personal learning network.

90
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.080
Lifelong learners surround themselves

91
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.480
with others they can learn from,

92
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.740
Whether in online forums, classrooms or book clubs,

93
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.410
lifelong learners take time to explore new

94
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.723
and challenging topics with others.

95
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.920
Just because you finished formal schooling

96
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.290
doesn't mean you have to stop learning.

97
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.150
Building lifelong learning habits

98
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.870
can help you improve your skills, expand job opportunities

99
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.840
and enjoy the wonders life has to offer.

100
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.350
And the good news is you already have everything you need

101
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.210
to become a lifelong learner.

102
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.190
Start by building high-quality habits

103
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.163
that will put you on the path to lifelong learning.
