<v ->At work and in life,</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.160
things change quickly and without notice.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.420
Being ready and willing

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.970
to adjust our attitudes and behaviors

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.280
helps us stay ahead of the curve.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.130
That's the essence of adaptability.

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.193
Let's look at what it means to be an adaptable employee.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.690
What sets adaptable people apart?

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.250
A specific set of traits

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.070
that enables them to adjust to challenges.

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.580
Here are five essential skills for adaptability.

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.640
The first skill is communication.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.530
During difficult situations,

14
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.040
employees must be able to express themselves clearly

15
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.193
and interact comfortably with diverse personalities.

16
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.060
The second skill is strategic thinking.

17
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.300
Adaptable people analyze issues from multiple angles

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.030
to understand the implications of their decisions

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.623
and shape their strategies.

20
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.280
The third skill is teamwork.

21
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.820
Adaptability means supporting and inspiring team members,

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.193
and setting one another up for success.

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.730
The next skill is organization.

24
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.070
Time management, attention to detail,

25
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.790
and a strong work ethic fuel adaptability.

26
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.460
Organized individuals set achievable goals

27
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.500
and identify tasks and strategies

28
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.033
necessary to reach to them.

29
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.690
The final skill is foresight.

30
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.030
Adaptable workers and organizations

31
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.620
anticipate new developments

32
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.780
in their industry and work environment

33
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.283
to prepare for challenges.

34
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.850
Organizations rely on employees

35
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.790
to navigate the changing business landscape,

36
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.240
but adaptability doesn't just benefit the organization.

37
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.210
When facing challenges, your poise and resourcefulness

38
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.973
impact your short and long-term success.

39
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.840
Adaptability is a skill you develop

40
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.660
through practice and determination.

41
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.800
It takes an optimistic attitude and proactive behavior.

42
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.743
Let's look at some other tips for staying adaptable.

43
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.670
First, commit to lifelong learning.

44
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.810
Learn from others,

45
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.300
seek professional development opportunities,

46
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.180
and expand your knowledge base.

47
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.660
Second, expect the unexpected.

48
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.210
Adaptability is about fighting complacency

49
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.750
and preparing for life's inevitable curve balls.

50
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.200
Recognize the signs of change, stay engaged,

51
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.300
and be realistic.

52
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.210
Third, embrace criticism.

53
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.260
Constructive criticism helps employees grow and improve.

54
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.020
Staying receptive to guidance and suggestions

55
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.250
demonstrates your commitment

56
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.983
to growth, learning, and improvement.

57
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.030
Next, find the opportunity.

58
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.640
Every challenge presents an opportunity.

59
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.350
Practice finding opportunities

60
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.843
embedded in challenges or transitions.

61
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.040
Finally, learn to fail better.

62
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.450
How you respond to failure

63
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.510
defines your resilience and adaptability.

64
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.010
You may fail again,

65
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.290
but you'll emerge with greater knowledge,

66
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.663
insight, and tools for success.

67
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.080
During challenging times,

68
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.190
adaptable employees emerge stronger and more resilient.

69
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.160
They understand that it takes flexibility and creativity

70
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
to respond to rapid unexpected changes at work.

71
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.640
The result is an organization and workforce

72
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.740
that thrive despite adversity

73
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.813
and are ready to meet new challenges.
